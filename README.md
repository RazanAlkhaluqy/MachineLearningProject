Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern, accounting for 17.9 million deaths in 2019, which represented 32% of all deaths worldwide [1]. A large proportion of these deaths, around 85%, were due to heart attacks and strokes, with many occurring in low and middle-income countries [1]. Additionally, CVDs contributed to 38% of premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases in people under 70 years old [1]. 
Early detection of CVD is important to help manage the condition through lifestyle changes and medication. So, this has motivated us to pursue this problem and try to propose a machine learning classification solution that helps health institutes and individuals get predictions on in predicting the presence or absence of CVD.
